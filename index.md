## About Me

I am a second year MSc Computer Science (2018-2020) student at the [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in) (CMI) where I am advised by Professor [KV Subrahmanyam](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~kv/). Previously, I completed my BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science (2015-2018) also from CMI. I have spent the 2018-19 academic year at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in) (IISc), Bangalore, where I have been working with Professors [Aditya Gopalan](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~aditya/index.html) and [Himanshu Tyagi](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/).

Broadly speaking, I am interested in optimization and the theoretical aspects of machine learning. Off late, I have been working mostly on online learning and online convex optimization. More specifically, I have been pondering over adaptive algorithms for online learning which can operate in information starved settings.

## About Me++

I was born in New Delhi, India and have been raised in many different cities across the world. We left for the US when I was 6 years old and spent time in Fairfax, VA and Naperville, IL before returning back to India when I was in grade 5. I had shifted 8 different schools by the time I started middle school! Thankfully, we settled down thereafter and were based out of Gurgaon, India for the remainder of my school years. Now, as my stint at CMI comes to an end, I look forward to joining a PhD program starting Fall 2020.
