## about me

I am a student of mathematics and computer science interested in optimization and the theory of machine learning. I am rather fascinated by sequential decision making and enjoy thinking about online prediction and online optimization. I am currently in my second year of a Master's in Computer Science course at the <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a> (CMI), prior to which I was an undergrad also at CMI. I spent the 2018-19 academic year at the <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), Bangalore, where I was working with Professors <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~aditya/index.html" target="_blank">Aditya Gopalan</a> and <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/" target="_blank">Himanshu Tyagi</a>. At CMI, I interact mostly with Professor <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/~kv/" target="_blank">KV Subrahmanyam</a>.

## about me++

I was born in New Delhi, India and have been raised in many different cities across the world. We left for the US when I was 6 years old and spent time in Fairfax, VA and Naperville, IL before returning back to India when I was in grade 5. I had shifted 8 different schools by the time I started middle school! Thankfully, we settled down thereafter and were based out of Gurgaon, India for the remainder of my school years. Now, as my stint at CMI comes to an end, I look forward to joining a PhD program starting Fall 2020.


## nonacademic interests

* <em>photography</em>: I've enjoyed photography for many years now and I try to get behind the lens as frequently as I can. Please check out <a href="https://500px.com/sid_mit" target="_blank">500px</a> for a curated exhibit of my photographs and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sid_mit/" target="_blank">instagram</a> for a friendlier, more casual selection.
* <em>music</em>: I've been a fan of trance and deep house for many years now. It all started when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqx25hfTZeg" target="_blank">suddenly summer</a> by Armin van Buuren and Ana Criado. These days, I'm absolutely in awe of Lane 8 and Above & Beyond. I also play the piano.
* <em>running</em>: I've been a distance runner for a couple of years now. It's mostly been casual running thus far, but I do have a few upcoming events I'm training towards.
* <em>sourdough bread</em>: No explanation required.
* <em>coffee</em>: On my 8th espresso shot of the day!
