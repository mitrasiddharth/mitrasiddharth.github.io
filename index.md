## About Me

I am a second year Master of Science in Computer Science (2018-2020) student at the <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a> (CMI) where I am advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/~kv/" target="_blank">KV Subrahmanyam</a>. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Mathematics and Computer Science (2015-2018) also from CMI. I have spent the 2018-19 academic year at the <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), Bangalore, where I have been working with Professors <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~aditya/index.html" target="_blank">Aditya Gopalan</a> and <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/" target="_blank">Himanshu Tyagi</a>.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in optimization and the theoretical aspects of machine learning. Off late, I have been working mostly on online learning and online convex optimization. More specifically, I have been pondering over adaptive algorithms for online learning which can operate in information starved settings.

## About Me++

I was born in New Delhi, India and have been raised in many different cities across the world. We left for the US when I was 6 years old and spent time in Fairfax, VA and Naperville, IL before returning back to India when I was in grade 5. I had shifted 8 different schools by the time I started middle school! Thankfully, we settled down thereafter and were based out of Gurgaon, India for the remainder of my school years. Now, as my stint at CMI comes to an end, I look forward to joining a PhD program starting Fall 2020.


## Nonacademic Interests

* <em>Photography</em>: I've enjoyed photography for many years now and I try to get behind the lens as frequently as I can. Please check out <a href="https://500px.com/sid_mit" target="_blank">500px</a> for a curated exhibit of my photographs and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sid_mit/" target="_blank">instagram</a> for a friendlier, more casual selection.
* <em>Music</em>: I've been a fan of trance and deep house for many years now. It all started when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqx25hfTZeg" target="_blank">suddenly summer</a> by Armin van Buuren and Ana Criado. These days, I'm absolutely in awe of Lane 8 and Above & Beyond. I also play the piano.
* <em>Running</em>: I've been a distance runner for a couple of years now. It's mostly been casual running thus far, but I do have a few upcoming events I'm training towards.
* <em>Sourdough Bread</em>: No explanation required.
* <em>Coffee</em>: On my 8th espresso shot of the day!
