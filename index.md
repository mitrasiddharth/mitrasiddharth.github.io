## about me

I am a student of Mathematics and Computer Science interested in Optimization and the theoretical underpinnings of Machine Learning. I am particularly fascinated by sequential decision making and enjoy thinking about online prediction and online optimization, especially within the context of non-euclidean optimization. I also have a soft spot for Physics-- I think it's an all-round really fun subject and also provides tons of intuition.

Currently, I'm in my 2nd year of a Master's in CS (2018-2020) degree at the <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a> (CMI). Prior to this, I was a Math+CS undergrad also at CMI (2015-2018). I spent the 2018-19 academic year as a visiting student at the <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), Bangalore, where I worked with Professors <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~aditya/index.html" target="_blank">Aditya Gopalan</a> and <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/" target="_blank">Himanshu Tyagi</a>. At CMI, I mostly interact with Professor <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/~kv/" target="_blank">KV Subrahmanyam</a>. I look forward to joining PhD programs starting Fall 2020.

* <em>photography:</em> I enjoy photography and get behind the lens as frequently as I can. Check out <a href="https://500px.com/sid_mit" target="_blank">500px</a> for a curated exhibit of my photographs and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sid_mit/" target="_blank">instagram</a> for a more casual selection.
* <em>trance + deep house:</em> It all started when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqx25hfTZeg" target="_blank">suddenly summer</a> by Armin and Ana ~7 years ago. These days, I'm absolutely in awe of Lane 8 (+ the entire TNH label) and Above & Beyond (+ the anjunabeats/anjunadeep family). On a somewhat related note, I also play the piano.
