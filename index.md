## about me

I am a student of mathematics and computer science interested in optimization and the theory of machine learning. I am rather fascinated by sequential decision making and enjoy thinking about online prediction and online optimization. 

I am currently in my second year of a master's in computer science program at the <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a> (CMI), prior to which I was an undergrad also at CMI. I spent the 2018-19 academic year at the <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), Bangalore, where I was working with Professors <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~aditya/index.html" target="_blank">Aditya Gopalan</a> and <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/" target="_blank">Himanshu Tyagi</a>. At CMI, I interact mostly with Professor <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/~kv/" target="_blank">KV Subrahmanyam</a>.




## news & updates

* <em>july 2019:</em> I will be attending the <a href="http://math.iisc.ac.in/~ifcam/Summer_School2019.htm" target="_blank">IFCAM summer school</a> on Mathematics for Data Science.
* <em>january 2019:</em> I will be attending the <a href="http://workshop.tcs.tifr.res.in" target="_blank">Workshop on Learning Theory</a>, co-organised by TIFR and MIT. 

## preprints
Expect this space to populate around the August end/early Sept. timeframe! Exciting stuff coming soon!




## nonacademic interests

* <em>photography:</em> I enjoy photography and get behind the lens as frequently as I can. Check out <a href="https://500px.com/sid_mit" target="_blank">500px</a> for a curated exhibit of my photographs and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sid_mit/" target="_blank">instagram</a> for a more casual selection.
* <em>music:</em> I am a fan of trance and deep house. It all started when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqx25hfTZeg" target="_blank">suddenly summer</a> ~7 years ago. These days, I'm absolutely in awe of Lane 8 (and the entire TNH label) and Above & Beyond (including again, the entire anjunabeats/anjunadeep label). I also play the piano.
* <em>sourdough bread</em>
